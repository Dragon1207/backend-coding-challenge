## Database

We could use a database to cache search results and avoid repeatedly fetching the same data from the GitHub API. 

A SQL database like PostgreSQL would be well suited to store the raw gist content and mapping of gists to files in a relational schema.

Alternatively, a NoSQL database like MongoDB may be better if the schema is more flexible or if we want fast lookups of gist metadata. Caching search results could improve performance and reduce load on the GitHub API. The database would need to be invalidated when gists are updated.

## Rate limiting
We should add rate limiting to protect the GitHub API from being abused through our service.

We could count requests to the search endpoint and return 429 errors after hitting a request limit within a given period. Temporary access tokens could also be used with throttling.

## Cloud deployment
Deploy the application to AWS/GCP/Azure using Docker and an orchestrator like Kubernetes.  

This would provide easy scaling and high availability. Services like API Gateway/Application Load Balancer could front the application.

## Monitoring
Add monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana to check application health, metrics like request latency/count and GitHub API request statistics.

Alerts could be created to notify outages or slow responses. Logging to Elasticsearch with Kibana could provide insights. 

## Automatic redeploys
Configure the deployment pipeline to automatically redeploy images on code changes using tools like GitHub actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.   

This ensures the latest code is running in production at all times without manual steps.

## Testing
Add more unit and integration tests covering core application functionality and error cases using a framework like PyTest.

Continuous testing would catch any regressions before deployments.
